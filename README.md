# Momentary Timed Switch

This smartapp makes a normal switch as a virtual momentary switch.

## Select switch, Set seconds.

This app waits the switch's `turned on` status.
If it gets `turned on` status, turn off after seconds that has been set.

It's useful at a situation that needs to supply power during just few seconds.
